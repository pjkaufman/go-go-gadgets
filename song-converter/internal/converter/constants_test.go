# A Glorious Church

\~ 1 \~ Do you hear them coming, Brother, Thronging up the steeps of light,  
Clad in glorious shining garments Blood-washed garments pure and white?

CHORUS:  
\'Tis a glorious Church without spot or wrinkle, Washed in the blood of the Lamb.  
\'Tis a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle, Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

\~ 2 \~ Do you hear the stirring anthems Filling all the earth and sky?  
\'Tis a grand victorious army. Lift its banner up on high!

\~ 3 \~ Never fear the clouds of sorrow; Never fear the storms of sin.  
Even now our joys begin.

\~ 4 \~ Wave the banner, shout His praises, For our victory is nigh!  
We shall join our conquering Savior. We shall reign with Him on high.

# He Is

\~ 1 \~ He is fairer than the lily of the valley, He is brighter than the morning star.  
He is purer than the snow, fresher than the breeze, Lovelier by far than all of these.

\~ 2 \~ But He calms all the storms, and conquers the raging seas.  
He is the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,  
Creator of the universe, and He\'s clothed with majesty.  
He is and ever more shall be.

# A Hymn Of Praise

\~ 1 \~ A hymn of praise I sing unto Thee,  
My gracious Redeemer, my wonderful Lord.  
Thy perfect salvation, thy wonderful Love,  
Let all the creation sing praise unto Thee.

\~ 2 \~ In the beginning Thy word spoke as life;  
Unto creation, the work of Thy hands.  
Heaven rejoiceth, the morning stars sang;  
A hymn of creation and praise unto Thee.
